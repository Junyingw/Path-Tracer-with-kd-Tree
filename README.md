# Code
Testing for intersection between a ray and a triangle is easy, but if the geometry has too many triangles, that would be time consuming. In this project, we use axis-aligned bounding box to build k-d tree, trying to optimize this problem. We can benifit k-d tree by only testing if the ray hits the bounding box. 
1) Using Obj-reader to read and detect triangle-based geometries. 
2) Building axis-align bounding box to generate k-d tree, and level down the tree.
3) For each level of the tree, find the midpoint of all triangles in the node; finding the longest axis of the bounding box for that nodeã€‚
4) Checking each triangle in the node, and then push them to the certain child node.
